4927	When I arranged your text, I left the important thing, removing the bias of your original writing. This is: The support of the upper classes to Felipe II and of the majority of the people to the prior. The proclamation of Felipe II as King of Portugal by the Cortes of Tomar with the name of Felipe I. However, I do not understand the stubbornness to preserve a clearly non-neutral text such as: There was no Castilian occupation because the campaign was quick and direct towards Lisbon, so the kingdom could not be occupied. The king already had the support of the upper classes, so the army did not assure anything. Finally, a phrase like "the overwhelming majority of the people" is clearly non-neutral. So please stop trying to impose a biased view of history and read WP: PVN. Thanks.	es	0

7183	The English (these colonizing gringos!), Do you think they can colonize Spain ??! Today, if Spain had a colony in England, the truth is that all European countries (with the United States, of course!), Would have already attacked the Spanish people !! Spaniards are not true Europeans to gringos! The truth is that the Anglo-Saxons consider Spain as an inferior country, and the Hispanics as an inferior race! Because we are not white and Celtic like them. We are Mediterranean and proud of it! Also, why do they want a territory where they can't stand the heat ...? Well, hopefully we will win!	es	0
65	Well, I would love to, even though I'm short on time, and I can't promise you too much. On the other hand, when choosing a candidate to become an AD, I advise you to look for a subject that you have studied in its entirety, or that you are going to study this year. Maybe some Roman law or the history of Spanish law. I would not recommend you go for the Civil Code, because it is an aubergine. If anything, something about the right of the person, heritage, autonomy, and others. In any case, make sure to differentiate the country to which the item belongs. That I am finding monstrosities as an administrative procedure, where they have mixed Spanish law with Argentine law, and some other that I cannot distinguish. It costs me more to fix it than to make a new item. Also, don't let a single article blind you. A shiny item is worthless if all the related items are in diapers, or even wrong. Fixing them is a thankless job, because they don't look good, but you also have to do it. In any case, let me know when you've chosen your target. Gaeddal	es	0

6067	PD: And no, evidently, from the little I understand about these irredential issues, it has nothing to do with one another, since pan-Hispanicism seems, according to what you want to deduce from reading the article, a mainly American movement, which seems to leave Spain a bit aside, due to mistrust because of the colonial past. The problem is that it is not known who has proposed this about pan-Hispanicism, nor who mistrusts Spain, nor who mistrusts Argentina and Mexico or who nothing, because the article has no references and as it is it could be a primary source or even hoax. So I can't tell you. By the way, the map is downright puzzling. A map of the Iberian union with Portugal to represent a supposed pan-Hispanicism? Is there any source that claims that ... Naples is claimed by someone Hispanic? Greece? (...) And so with all the flags on the card.	es	0

6651	Xenophobia is punishable by Spanish law, if this party had called xenophobic demonstrations, as stated here, they would not have been admitted by the courts or the government delegations that authorize such demonstrations. Another different thing is what some of the assistants have shouted. The party therefore calls demonstrations against illegal immigration, or xenophobia or racism, or is it that you do not know that there are people of gypsy or African origin. Therefore, speaking of racist or xenophobic acts seems to me rather ill-intentioned, because it is a crime and I ask that it be changed to illegal immigration. http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/222135/0/gitanos/partido/ultraderecha/	es	0

If you find more references that is a relevant person, whose biography should appear in an encyclopedia, place them as well. If you need help, come back to my page whenever you want.

6608	Dear Poverino, According to the Rae, the names of works of art or artistic concepts can be translated or not, if you choose not to translate them, they should always be in italics, to indicate that it is foreignism. So far the norm. However, in general, it is chosen to translate the name of more classical works or that already have an extensive bibliography (for example "The Birth of Venus") and the more contemporary or less known works are usually left in their original language (the Rauschenberg Combines). The same happens with the sites, Casa Blanca is translated, but La Défense does not. If you are looking to homogenize the article, I would recommend that you continue translating the names of the works, if any translation squeaks a bit (such as Barrios Españoles), you could leave the original name. Nor should we fall into the absurdity of completely translating everything, but the Queens neighborhood in NY would be the Queens neighborhood! In any case, good luck with the magnificent work you are doing! Cordially, Enric de	es	0

4318	This article oozes anti-anti-Catholic value judgments and tries to make Catholics look like victims. This is precisely what is making me more convinced anti-Catholic every day. And for the record, when I say convinced I mean just the opposite of fervent. fervor is a quality peculiar to Catholics. For example: When referring to Elizabeth I of England, he mentions that she aggressively reestablished persecution against those who remained loyal to Catholicism and refused to fall into apostasy. Go. You couldn't be more awkwardly manipulative. Now it is going to turn out that joining the reform and rejecting the church management of the Borgia and the pornocracy is labeled as apostasy. Send eggs. Well good. If that is apostasy, I will be happy to be an apostate.	es	0

The religion of Japan is as false as the others. Another thing, swearing to God in vain goes against one of the ten commandments, and those leaders that you mention do not represent any God, maybe you think they do, but perhaps it is the Devil who tries to convince you. Think about it, because that being is so intelligent that it can take on any identity, even the spiritual leaders that you see in churches or mosques.

No, more hiding, more deception, more lies, more trade in female - and child - meat; Let's not forget that we are talking about buying and selling babies, more commercial garbage, more slavery. To things by name: There are those who have children, whether they want them or not, because the State sends it or the priest sends it or the male sends it. There are those who do not have children, because they cannot or do not want to, and dedicate themselves to living their life with other perspectives. And there are those who have pasta and buy them, even if they do not have a uterus or it does not work. And all this discussion, which is entangled in stupidities about the neutrality of a single term, takes the focus away from the most important thing, which is this new episode in the sexual exploitation of women.

The only thing that makes them different from ordinary people is their gaze lost in illusions (just like fans of Christianity). The supposed clearance is only a state of loss of contact with reality, the product of brainwashing that, in addition, costs the person who goes through it to spend their life savings.

7168	I have made some modifications, however, it is far from being a good article mainly due to lack of references and subjectivism. The article gives the impression of being someone's story, full of attention-grabbing adjectives and lacking in foundation. I have also removed huge lists of things that were in the article, family photos, anecdotes, among others. I have been busy in other articles, however, I consider that as basic we should have the articles of cities of Venezuela well written. A hug brother The	es	0

6023	The name of República Srpska is a linguistic aberration, say the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Complutense University or the sursum corda. It's like saying Federal Republic of Deutschland. The name of the Serbian Republic is confusing, but correct. The problem can be solved with the name Serbian Republic (of Bosnia-Herzegovina). In any case, it is not our fault that the Serbian name violates the alleged rights of Bosnians or Croats - after all, srpska means the same thing, only that the majority of Spaniards do not know it. It's like refusing to call China the People's Republic of China, just because Tibetans, Manchu, and so on also live there. It is not our business to do justice to the language: only translate. On the other hand, it seems incredible to me that the Complutense University does not know that, if Srpska is a noun as well as an adjective in Serbian, exactly the same thing happens with Serbia in Spanish.	es	0
5659	At first it was thought of putting them in cassettes such as floppy disks or minidiscs, but when this polymer was discovered it was no longer necessary. The point is that this material is much harder than that of DVDs and HD-DVDs (thus avoiding many scratches) and also repels dust. On the other hand, it allows a better reflection of the rays that allows that although there is dirt in many cases readings can be made (this I do not remember well as it was). ()	es	0
